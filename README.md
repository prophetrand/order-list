# Movie Time

## Description
This [web application](https://shielded-coast-01014.herokuapp.com/) allows users to save the title of movies to the watchlist, which is saved to a SQL database. Users can click the *"watched it"* button on each movie in **Movies to Watch** to move it to the **Watched Movies** list, and then the *"nevermind"* button to move it back. Users add movies to the watchlist using the **Add a Movie** form, which POSTs their entry to the database.

## Acknowledgments
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) has been my go-to for descriptive tutorials on HTML, CSS, and Javascript syntax and best practices. I am eternally grateful for their massive store of documentation.
* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is another resource for documentation on HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I find myself using more and more often as I work through deeper Javascript.
* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) deserves another round of thanks for being a really cool way to develop backend code in Javascript.
